# 1kUSD — Public FAQ (Contributors Edition)

**What is 1kUSD?**  
A community-driven, fully on-chain stablecoin. Parity is kept via a Peg-Stability-Module (PSM); collateral is converted to approved stables on deposit (no CDP-style debt).

**How is it different from CDP stablecoins (e.g., DAI)?**  
We do *not* target a collateralization ratio. We run a parity machine (PSM) and use **convert-on-deposit** via the AutoConverter to keep reserves stable-denominated. See: [PSM vs CDP](/PSM_VS_CDP/).

**How is the peg maintained in stress?**  
Rate limits + per-asset caps, oracle staleness/deviation guards (fail-closed), and a pause circuit (guardian with sunset; DAO via timelock). Fees are parameterized via the Parameter Registry.

**Where do parameters live? Who can change them?**  
On-chain [Parameter Registry](/PARAMETER_REGISTRY/). Writes only through DAO/Timelock. Guardian can *pause only* and auto-expires (sunset).

**Which oracles? How do you avoid manipulation?**  
Multi-source aggregation (median/trimmed-mean), per-feed maxAge and maxDeviationBps, single coherent snapshot used for quote & execution. Providers are pluggable and governed.

**How does 1kUSD integrate with Kaspa?**  
No consensus changes. We use an indexer finality watermark and adapt to Kaspa throughput as it evolves. See: [Kaspa Integration Notes](/KASPA_INTEGRATION_NOTES/).

**What is the security posture?**  
Specs + invariants (I1–I17), fuzz/property tests, static analysis in CI, audits & bug bounty before mainnet. Incident & parameter change runbooks are in docs.

**Where is the code/specs?**  
- Contract specs: `contracts/specs/`
- Interfaces: `contracts/interfaces/`
- Test plan & security: `tests/specs/`
- Docs site (this): `docs/` (MkDocs)

**How to contribute a change?**  
Open an issue, fork, PR with green CI (unit + invariants + static + docs). For protocol changes, include the spec delta and updated invariants mapping.

**Roadmap (high level)**  
EVM testnet → EVM mainnet + integrations → Kaspa native interfaces → Kaspa L1 parity module.
