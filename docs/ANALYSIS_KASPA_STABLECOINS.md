## 🧩 Overview

Kaspa, known for its high-throughput blockDAG and PoW-based decentralization, has become an attractive base layer for experimental stablecoin designs.  
As of late 2025, three main initiatives can be identified:

| Project | Type | Mechanism | Collateral | Notable Features |
|----------|------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **1kUSD** | *Algorithmic / Collateral-assisted* | Peg Stability Module + Oracle Guards | Wrapped Kaspa + whitelisted stable assets | Fully on-chain, DAO-controlled, fee-burn loop |
| **Gigawatt** | *Fiat-backed hybrid* | Centralized issuance | Custodial reserves (USDC, USDT) | Conventional model, limited transparency |
| **Kash** | *Experimental synthetic* | Derivative index tracking | Token baskets + market hedging | Focus on volatility absorption rather than full peg |

## ⚙️ 1kUSD Architecture Summary

**1kUSD** introduces a *Peg Stability Module* (PSM) interacting with a *Collateral Vault* to maintain a soft-peg to USD.  
Instead of issuing debt positions (like DAI’s CDPs), it uses deterministic swaps between whitelisted stable assets and the native 1kUSD token.

Key advantages:

1. **No debt risk** – no liquidation auctions.  
2. **Hard oracle guards** – halts swaps if data stale > 2 blocks.  
3. **Safety Automata** – embedded contract layer that can pause or rate-limit operations.  
4. **DAO Treasury Bridge** – automated fee collection and redistribution.  
5. **Kaspa compatibility** – ready for future L1/L2 bridging.

## 🧮 Gigawatt

Gigawatt acts as a transitional bridge stablecoin, anchoring value via custodial backing while offering on-chain mint/burn interfaces.  
However, its reliance on external custodians contradicts Kaspa’s decentralization ethos and limits censorship resistance.

## 🌐 Kash

Kash explores algorithmic price stabilization through synthetic indices and multi-asset baskets.  
While innovative, it lacks full collateral transparency and still depends on off-chain arbitrage activity for peg maintenance.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Among the existing experiments, **1kUSD stands out as the most decentralized and technically complete approach**.  
It inherits Kaspa’s high-speed DAG layer, introduces safety-guarded smart-contract logic, and establishes a truly autonomous, community-governed stablecoin model.
