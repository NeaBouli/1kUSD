gas

Pass: gas.json present; file parse ok (no threshold enforced yet).

collate (summary)

Aggregates above into security-findings.json and ci-summary.json.

Overall pass: all upstream jobs green + summary.ok=true.

Artifacts

Notes

Placeholders emit minimal JSON so pipeline stays green until tests land.

Tighten thresholds as suites are implemented.
