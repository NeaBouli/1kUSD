## The Vision

1kUSD is not just another ERC-20 stablecoin. It is the first step toward a **native, decentralized stablecoin on the KASPA network**.

Today, 1kUSD runs as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum — fully tested, audited, and ready for deployment. When KASPA's smart contract layer enables programmable token issuance, 1kUSD will migrate to a native KASPA implementation, bringing the same security guarantees to KASPA's high-throughput BlockDAG.

## Why 1kUSD?

- **No custody risk** — reserves are held in on-chain smart contracts, not by a company
- **No liquidation risk** — 1kUSD uses a Peg Stability Module (PSM), not CDP-style debt positions
- **Safety-first** — circuit breakers, rate limits, oracle guards, and automated pause controls
- **Transparent** — on-chain proof of reserves, open-source code, public audit package
- **KASPA-native goal** — designed from day one for the KASPA ecosystem

## How It Works

1. **Deposit** approved stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI)
2. **Receive** 1kUSD at a 1:1 rate (minus a small fee)
3. **Redeem** 1kUSD anytime to get your stablecoins back
4. **Arbitrage** keeps the peg — if 1kUSD drifts, traders profit by restoring it

The protocol is governed by a DAO with timelock — no single admin can change parameters without a waiting period.
