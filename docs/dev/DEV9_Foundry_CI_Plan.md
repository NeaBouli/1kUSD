# DEV-9 Foundry CI Hardening Plan

This document outlines DEV-9's proposal for hardening the Foundry-based
CI workflows in the 1kUSD project. It is *planning only* and does not
change any CI workflows by itself.

All changes described here are proposals and MUST be approved by the
Architect before any workflow YAML is modified.

## Context

The 1kUSD project uses Foundry for Solidity testing and tooling. Multiple
GitHub Actions workflows exist that interact with Foundry (e.g. format,
tests, combined CI).

DEV-9's responsibility is to improve stability and reproducibility of
these workflows, without touching the Solidity contracts or economic
layer logic.

## Goals

- Make CI runs more deterministic (less dependent on "whatever Foundry
  version is current" at runtime).
- Reduce flaky behavior caused by toolchain updates or cache changes.
- Keep job definitions readable and maintainable.
- Avoid changes to protocol logic or test semantics.

Non-goals:

- No changes to contracts/ or protocol logic.
- No changes to the underlying economic layer or parameters.
- No addition of new, complex infra (self-hosted runners, external
  services) without a separate design and approval.

## Proposed Hardening Steps (High-level)

1. **Foundry Version Pinning**

   - Introduce explicit version pinning for the Foundry toolchain in
     Foundry-related workflows (e.g. foundry-test.yml, forge-ci.yml,
     foundry.yml).
   - Prefer a stable, tagged Foundry release over an unpinned nightly.
   - Make the pinned version visible and easy to update (e.g. single
     env variable or single action configuration).

2. **Caching Strategy**

   - Use GitHub Actions caching for:
     - Foundry toolchain artifacts (if not handled by the selected
       Foundry action).
     - Relevant build/test artifacts where it materially speeds up CI.
   - Keep cache keys simple and tied to:
     - Foundry version
     - OS / job matrix entries
     - Optionally, lockfile hashes (for dependencies) where appropriate.
   - Avoid overly aggressive cache reuse that might hide issues.

3. **Job Structure & Separation**

   - Ensure that formatting (fmt), unit tests, and possibly lint/static
     analysis are clearly separated jobs or steps, so a failure is easy
     to attribute.
   - Make sure Foundry-related jobs:
     - Run on a consistent OS image (e.g. ubuntu-latest).
     - Share a consistent strategy for setting up Foundry.

4. **Error Reporting & Logs**

   - Ensure that Foundry commands are invoked with useful flags for CI
     (e.g. verbose where needed, but without excessive noise).
   - Consider capturing artifacts in case of failure (e.g. junit-style
     reports) if the project already uses such patterns.

## Implementation Approach (Proposal)

DEV-9 proposes the following sequence for implementing CI hardening:

1. **Inventory & Documentation**
   - DONE: DEV9_Workflows_Inventory.md lists all workflows.
   - This document (DEV9_Foundry_CI_Plan.md) captures the plan.

2. **Minimal Version Pinning in One Workflow**
   - Select one Foundry-related workflow (e.g. foundry-test.yml) as the
     initial candidate.
   - Introduce a minimal, explicit Foundry version pin (e.g. via a
     standard Foundry setup action and a version input).
   - Verify that CI runs remain green.

3. **Rollout to Additional Workflows**
   - Apply the same pinning pattern to other Foundry-related workflows,
     if they exist and are active.
   - Keep the version definition centralized as much as possible.

4. **Introduce/Refine Caching**
   - Add caches for Foundry artifacts where this clearly improves CI
     runtime without harming determinism.
   - Monitor for issues and adjust cache keys as needed.

5. **Optional Enhancements**
   - If the Architect approves, additional small improvements can be
     made, such as:
     - More structured test reporting.
     - Clearer matrix definitions.
     - Better separation of formatting vs testing steps.

## Coordination & Approval

- DEV-9 will not modify any CI workflows in a breaking way without a
  dedicated patch and clear communication.
- Each workflow change will be encapsulated in its own dev9_XX patch
  script and referenced in logs/project.log.
- If at any point a workflow becomes flaky or unstable after a change,
  DEV-9 will propose a rollback or adjustment in coordination with the
  Architect.

## DEV-9 30 – Foundry version rollout

To keep Foundry CI behaviour consistent across workflows, DEV-9 30 introduced
a canonical Foundry toolchain version and rolled it out to all relevant
workflows.

**Canonical source:**

- `.github/workflows/foundry.yml`
  - The version configured here is treated as the single source of truth.

**Rollout targets:**

- `.github/workflows/buybackvault-strategy-guard.yml`
- `.github/workflows/forge-ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/foundry-test.yml`

A helper script (`patches/dev9_30_foundry_version_rollout.sh`) synchronises
the `version:` field in any workflow that uses `foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain`
with the canonical value from `foundry.yml`.

### Operational notes

- When changing the Foundry version, update **only** `foundry.yml` first.
- Then re-run the rollout script to propagate the version to other workflows.
- This keeps CI deterministic and avoids drift between different Foundry-based
  jobs.

Future hardening (e.g. cache tuning, matrix cleanups) should build on this
canonical version model rather than introducing ad-hoc pins.
