# PSM Integration Guide (skeleton)

> Status: DEV-10 skeleton – content to be filled in later.

## 1. Overview

This document will describe how external integrators can safely interact with
the Peg Stability Module (PSM) to swap collateral assets to and from 1kUSD.

It will focus on:

- public contract interfaces (functions / events),
- typical swap flows,
- limits, fees and spreads,
- failure modes and how to handle them off-chain.

## 2. Core functions & events (TODO)

_TODO: List and describe the most relevant public functions and events for
the PSM from an integrator perspective._

## 3. Typical flow: collateral ↔ 1kUSD (TODO)

_TODO: Describe end-to-end example flows (happy path and edge cases) for
swapping collateral assets into 1kUSD and back._

## 4. Integration checklist (TODO)

_TODO: Provide a short checklist for integrators (validation, monitoring,
error handling)._
