# Reports & Status Index\n\nThis index lists the main status, governance and sync reports for the 1kUSD\nEconomic Core. It is meant as a human entry point for auditors, architects\nand developers who need to understand *what happened when* without digging\nthrough the entire docs tree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Economic Layer v0.51.0 – Core Status\n\nThese reports describe the baseline Economic Layer (v0.51.0) and its\ngovernance handover:\n\n- **Economic Layer project status (v0.51.0)**\n  - High-level status of the Economic Layer at v0.51.0.\n  - See: `PROJECT_STATUS_EconomicLayer_v051.md`\n\n- **Governance handover (v0.51.0)**\n  - Governance view on the v0.51.0 Economic Layer.\n  - See: `DEV87_Governance_Handover_v051.md`\n\n- **Dev7/Economic Layer ↔ Security sync**\n  - How Economic Layer work lines up with the Security & Risk docs.\n  - See: `DEV89_Dev7_Sync_EconomicLayer_Security.md`\n\n---\n\n## 2. Security & Risk\n\nThese documents are authored under DEV-8 and focus on security posture,\nrisk management and emergency handling:\n\n- **Security & risk documentation (overview)**\n  - Includes audit plans, bug bounty outline, PoR specs, collateral risk and\n    depeg runbooks.\n  - See the `docs/security/` and `docs/risk/` directories for details.\n\nFor exact file lists, refer to the directory structure; this index only\nhighlights the main clusters.\n\n---\n\n## 3. CI, Docs & Release Status\n\nThese reports describe how CI, docs builds and release checks are wired:\n\n- **Docs build & CI (DEV-93)**\n  - Overview of the dedicated docs-build workflow, triggers and guarantees.\n  - See: `DEV93_CI_Docs_Build_Report.md`\n\n- **Release status workflow (DEV-94)**\n  - Describes the Release Status Check workflow and its expectations on\n    reports and status files.\n  - See: `DEV94_Release_Status_Workflow_Report.md`\n\n- **Release status script & checks (DEV-95+)**\n  - Details of the local `scripts/check_release_status.sh` helper and how\n    it ties into CI.\n  - See the individual DEV-95+ reports under `docs/reports/`.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Infra & Integrations (DEV-9 / DEV-10)\n\nThese reports bridge infra/CI work (DEV-9) and integration docs (DEV-10):\n\n- **DEV-9 Infra status (r1/r2)**\n  - Status of infra/CI helpers, docker baseline, docs build settings and\n    linkcheck workflows.\n  - See:\n    - `docs/dev/DEV9_Status_Infra_r1.md`\n    - `docs/dev/DEV9_Status_Infra_r2.md`\n\n- **DEV-9 Infra backlog**\n  - Living backlog for infra/CI work (Zone A/B/C).\n  - See: `docs/dev/DEV9_Backlog.md`\n\n- **DEV-10 Integrations status (r1)**\n  - Summary of the initial integrations/DevEx layer and its boundaries.\n  - See: `docs/dev/DEV10_Status_Integrations_r1.md`\n\n- **DEV-10 Integrations backlog**\n  - Planned r2+ items for integrator experience.\n  - See: `docs/dev/DEV10_Backlog.md`\n\n- **DEV-9 / DEV-10 sync report (r1)**\n  - How infra/CI (DEV-9) and integrations/DevEx (DEV-10) line up.\n  - See: `DEV9_Dev10_Sync_Infra_Integrations_r1.md`\n\n---\n\n## 5. How to use this index\n\n- Start here when you need to understand:\n  - *Which Economic Layer version is live?*\n  - *Which reports must exist for a given release?*\n  - *How infra/CI and integrations work together?*\n- Use the linked reports as anchors and then drill into:\n  - `docs/architecture/`\n  - `docs/security/` and `docs/risk/`\n  - `docs/dev/` for role-specific logs and plans.\n\nThis page is intentionally high-level and should be kept up to date whenever\nnew major reports or status documents are added.\n\n- **BLOCK_DEV9_DEV10_Infra_Integrations_r1** – Infra & Integrations block report (DEV-9 / DEV-10, r1)\n\n## Block Reports\n\n- [BLOCK_DEV49_DEV11_OracleRequired_Block_r1](BLOCK_DEV49_DEV11_OracleRequired_Block_r1.md)\n
