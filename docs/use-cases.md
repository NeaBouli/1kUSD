# Use Cases

## Stable Value in the KASPA Ecosystem

Every blockchain ecosystem needs a stable unit of account. 1kUSD provides that foundation for KASPA.

### Payments & Commerce
Accept payments denominated in a stable USD value. No more worrying about price swings between the time of sale and settlement.

### DeFi Building Block
1kUSD is designed to be a composable DeFi primitive:

- **Liquidity pools** — pair 1kUSD with other tokens for low-volatility LP positions
- **Lending** — use 1kUSD as collateral or borrow against it
- **Yield** — earn fees from providing 1kUSD liquidity

### Safe Harbor
During market volatility, move into 1kUSD without leaving the on-chain ecosystem. Your funds stay decentralized and redeemable — no need to trust a centralized exchange.

### Cross-Chain Value Transfer
Move stable USD value between chains. As 1kUSD migrates to native KASPA, it will serve as a bridge currency between the Ethereum and KASPA ecosystems.

### Treasury Management
DAOs and protocols can hold treasury reserves in 1kUSD — decentralized, transparent, and always redeemable at $1.
